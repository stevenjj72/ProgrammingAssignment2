## This assignment was accomplished by Steve Jones
## 
## This is version one of the function, made only to test git commands
## If this is the final version I submit on before it is due, I've had a really bad weekend

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
## Yes, I really intend to put code here
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
